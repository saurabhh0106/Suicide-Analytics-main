This project focused on analyzing global suicide trends using a dataset in Jupyter Notebook.
The objective was to uncover patterns, correlations, and contributing factors behind suicide rates across different demographics and regions.

Key Highlights:
1.Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handled missing values and standardized data for accurate analysis.
Filtered data by country, age group, gender, and year.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized suicide rates using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Analyzed trends over time, highlighting regions with the highest rates.
Explored correlations between suicide rates and socioeconomic factors like GDP per capita and population.

3.Key Insights:
Identified age groups and genders most vulnerable to suicide.
Detected regions with consistently high rates, suggesting cultural or economic influences.
Found possible links between economic downturns and rising suicide rates.

*Tools and Libraries:
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Outcome: Created an interactive, visual report on suicide trends and identified key areas for targeted interventions.
